## Description

This project is a highly flexible Invoice Management System built with Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript (strict mode), and React Hook Form with Zod for form validation. The UI follows Atomic Design Principles to promote reusability and maintainability, while Tailwind CSS ensures a fully customizable and efficient styling approach.

### Key Features
âœ… Atomic Design Architecture â€“ Components are structured to minimize redundant code and maximize reusability.
âœ… Dynamic Data-View System â€“ customizable field and developers can use on any modules.
âœ… Persistent Invoice Data â€“ Uses IndexedDB (Dexie.js) to store and manage invoice data across page refreshes.
âœ… Validation with Zod & React Hook Form â€“ Ensures strong data integrity and smooth form handling.
âœ… Snackbar Notification System â€“ A globally managed snackbar (with context and hooks) for displaying success, error, and info messages.
âœ… Tailwind CSS for Styling â€“ Chosen over MUI for complete styling control without unnecessary dependencies.
